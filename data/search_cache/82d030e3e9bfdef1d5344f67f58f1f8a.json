Check out [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs).\n\nTo help you ship LangChain apps to production faster, check out [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n[LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) is a unified developer platform for building, testing, and monitoring LLM applications.\n\n## Quick Install\n\n```bash\npip install langchain\n```\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is this?\n\nLangChain is the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs. With under 10 lines of code, you can connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and [more](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview). LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.\n\nWe recommend you use LangChain if you want to quickly build agents and autonomous applications. Use [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview), our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows, heavy customization, and carefully controlled latency.\n\nLangChain [agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/agents) are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. (You do not need to know LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.)\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Documentation\n\nFor full documentation, see the [API reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/langchain/). For conceptual guides, tutorials, and examples on using LangChain, see the [LangChain Docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview).\n\n## \ud83d\udcd5 Releases & Versioning\n\nSee our [Releases](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/release-policy) and [Versioning](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/versioning) policies.\n\n## \ud83d\udc81 Contributing\n\nAs an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether it be in the form of a new feature, improved infrastructure, or better documentation.\n\nFor detailed information on how to contribute, see the [Contributing Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/contributing/overview).\n",
